Here are the summaries of the implemented application: 

1.There are three modules in this app, Home, Search, App.

2.App renders Home or Search through switchMode() function.

3.All the data is fetched through Web API.

4.The fetched random beer is shown in Home.

5.The searched beers' information is shown in Search.

6.I generated a summary for each beer and show it in the webpage.

7.Some images of beers are not provided by the API. Instead, I imported an image named "image-not-available.png"

8.To beautify the layout, I used the css styles provided by Bootstrap.

9.More functions, like searching the description, could be easily implemented if needed.
